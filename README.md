# Unikitty-Mod
This is a mod I created for my daughter that adds in Unikittys along with a very OP armor.

Unikittys are basically just a copy of the ocelot mixed with the coloring aspect of the sheep, however they will not run away from player making it easy to tame them.

- they can be tamed as pets using a golden fish.
- breed using minecraft fish.
- they can be colored using dye like sheep.
- also like sheep different colored parents can breed a colored baby.
- they will cough up hairballs (colored string) at the same frequency as chickens drop eggs.
  - 4 colored string can be crafted into wool of that color.

If named "kaena" with a nametag it will become a rainbow unikitty, like when a sheep is named "_jeb".
If tamed only the owner can change it's color, or it will hiss.

Drops when killed:
- 4 string of the same color as the unikitty.
- raw unikitty meat, can be cooked in furnace.

Player killed drops:
- chance of dropping either blue crystal or unikitty horn.

Spawn
- They will spawn in forest & roofed forest biomes in groups of 3-5.
- Default spawn colors are white, black & orange.

Armor is extremely OP & unbreakable.
